German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron s call for a separate budget for the eurozone.  We should be ready to invest more in our future,  Gabriel told Germany s Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more.   Gabriel said Macron s proposals to reform the European Union would be  very important  in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. He said he was enthusiastic about Macron s core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player. The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections. Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron s proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place. Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January. Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a  roadmap  with all eurozone leaders by June. Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.     \",\n          \"Donald Trump likes feuds. He cannot, for any reason, take criticism, so the second someone says something less than a million percent complimentary about him, Trump has to lash out. His latest target is a union leader for Carrier, the company that Trump has been boasting about all over the place because he supposedly saved bunches of jobs. However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces. They swallow every outrage, every lie, as if none of it matters. They refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their Cheeto Jesus, and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes.Look forward to four years of not just Trump acting like a whiny, narcissistic baby, but, apparently, he ll have the might of the entire GOP behind him doing the same.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"The police in Brazil said on Saturday that they had made the first arrest in the search for more than 30 possible attackers in the gang rape of a    girl, a case that has prompted widespread outrage and vows by the federal government to combat crimes against women, news agencies reported. Brazilians reacted with shock after the May 21 assault came to light last week. Graphic photos and videos of the unconscious, naked teenager were posted on Twitter, and several men joked online about the attack. The authorities said the teenager had been raped in the S\\u00e3o Jo\\u00e3o shantytown on the west side of Rio de Janeiro as she was visiting her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The girl told the police that she was briefly alone with him but remembered nothing until she woke up naked the next day in another building among dozens of men who had guns. The first arrest came after the military police fanned out in search of four suspects who had been identified, the news organization Agence   reported. The police said they did not know if the boyfriend was one of the attackers, though he was being sought. The case has rocked Brazil, Latin America\\u2019s largest nation, and highlighted its   problem of violence against women. President Michel Temer promised to create a federal police unit to address crimes against women, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cIt\\u2019s absurd that in the 21st century we have to live with barbarous crimes like this,\\u201d said Mr. Temer, who also called an emergency meeting of the security ministers for each of Brazil\\u2019s states to consider   crimes. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio on Friday night with signs that said \\u201cMachismo kills\\u201d and \\u201cNo means no,\\u201d Agence   reported. In S\\u00e3o Paulo, protesters made a mural with messages that included \\u201cI like to wear necklines, that\\u2019s not an invitation to rape me. \\u201d The girl, in brief comments to the O Globo newspaper, said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the stigma that hurts me the most. It is as if people are saying: \\u2018It\\u2019s her fault. She was using scanty clothes.\\u2019 I want people to know that it is not the woman\\u2019s fault. You can\\u2019t blame a robbery victim for being robbed. \\u201d At a news conference on Friday, the police said the girl had reported being raped by 33 men officials said they had been unable to confirm how many men might have taken part. Rio\\u2019s police chief, Fernando Veloso, said that if images had not been posted online, the authorities might not have learned of the attack. The Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies found that more than 92, 000 women were killed in   crimes, including rape and domestic abuse, from 1980 to 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0437\\u0430 \\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435. \\u0411\\u043b\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u044e \\u0432\\u0430\\u0441.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron s call for a separate budget for the eurozone.  We should be ready to invest more in our future,  Gabriel told Germany s Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more.   Gabriel said Macron s proposals to reform the European Union would be  very important  in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. He said he was enthusiastic about Macron s core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player. The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections. Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron s proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place. Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January. Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a  roadmap  with all eurozone leaders by June. Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.     \",\n          \"Donald Trump likes feuds.

However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces. They swallow every outrage, every lie, as if none of it matters. They refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their Cheeto Jesus, and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes.Look forward to four years of not just Trump acting like a whiny, narcissistic baby, but, apparently, he ll have the might of the entire GOP behind him doing the same.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"The police in Brazil said on Saturday that they had made the first arrest in the search for more than 30 possible attackers in the gang rape of a    girl, a case that has prompted widespread outrage and vows by the federal government to combat crimes against women, news agencies reported. Brazilians reacted with shock after the May 21 assault came to light last week. Graphic photos and videos of the unconscious, naked teenager were posted on Twitter, and several men joked online about the attack. The authorities said the teenager had been raped in the S\\u00e3o Jo\\u00e3o shantytown on the west side of Rio de Janeiro as she was visiting her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The girl told the police that she was briefly alone with him but remembered nothing until she woke up naked the next day in another building among dozens of men who had guns. The first arrest came after the military police fanned out in search of four suspects who had been identified, the news organization Agence   reported. The police said they did not know if the boyfriend was one of the attackers, though he was being sought. The case has rocked Brazil, Latin America\\u2019s largest nation, and highlighted its   problem of violence against women. President Michel Temer promised to create a federal police unit to address crimes against women, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cIt\\u2019s absurd that in the 21st century we have to live with barbarous crimes like this,\\u201d said Mr. Temer, who also called an emergency meeting of the security ministers for each of Brazil\\u2019s states to consider   crimes. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio on Friday night with signs that said \\u201cMachismo kills\\u201d and \\u201cNo means no,\\u201d Agence   reported. In S\\u00e3o Paulo, protesters made a mural with messages that included \\u201cI like to wear necklines, that\\u2019s not an invitation to rape me. \\u201d The girl, in brief comments to the O Globo newspaper, said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the stigma that hurts me the most. It is as if people are saying: \\u2018It\\u2019s her fault. She was using scanty clothes.\\u2019 I want people to know that it is not the woman\\u2019s fault. You can\\u2019t blame a robbery victim for being robbed. \\u201d At a news conference on Friday, the police said the girl had reported being raped by 33 men officials said they had been unable to confirm how many men might have taken part. Rio\\u2019s police chief, Fernando Veloso, said that if images had not been posted online, the authorities might not have learned of the attack. The Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies found that more than 92, 000 women were killed in   crimes, including rape and domestic abuse, from 1980 to 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0437\\u0430 \\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435. \\u0411\\u043b\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u044e \\u0432\\u0430\\u0441.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63641,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EU too? Lawmakers denounce harassment in Brussels STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers accused their own parliament on Wednesday of failing to protect staff from sexual harassment, as allegations of abuse in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein case have raised questions over standards also in Brussels  institutions. Debating an emergency motion calling on authorities to beef up rules and enforcement of gender equality laws and sanctions for abuse in workplaces across Europe, members of the European Parliament also demanded the EU legislature stop turning a blind eye to  disgusting  practices by some of their own colleagues.  Here, today, in the very heart of European democracy, we have women being molested and harassed,  Polish member Jadwiga Wisniewska told the chamber.  This is unimaginable.  This month s allegations about Hollywood producer Weinstein - who denies all accusations of non-consensual sex - has set off a wave of reflection about sexual harassment in Europe as in other parts of the world. Several MEPs held signs bearing the Twitter hashtag #metoo.  I have been sexually harassed, just like millions of other women in the European Union,  German member Terry Reintke said.  It is about time that we very clearly say that we should not be ashamed. The perpetrators should be ashamed.  In the EU institutions themselves, with an unusual mix of powerful hierarchies, politics and a culturally diverse workforce drawn from across the continent, women are accusing managers of doing too little for too long to stamp out abuse.  We ve all heard the stories and rumors going on for many years,  Britain s Margot Parker said during the debate in Strasbourg, the Brussels-based parliament s second home.  The very place that claims to legislate against this sort of disgusting behavior is turning a blind eye to its practice.  This week, Parliament President Antonio Tajani spoke of his  shock and indignation  after a Sunday Times report on more than a dozen mostly young female parliamentary aides who complained of groping, stalking and other harassment by male lawmakers. He pledged to step up existing protections to encourage people to come forward, something campaigners say is overdue.  It comes as no surprise to those of us working for years on the fight to end violence against women that sexual harassment is also widespread throughout the EU institutions,  said the European Women s Lobby, a Brussels-based, pan-European organization.  There is still inadequate means to ensure that women still feel safe enough to come forward to report incidences.  At the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU which employs 32,000 people, 55 percent of them women, measures have been in place since 2006 to prevent any form of harassment and to protect whistleblowers. Over the past five years an average of 13 complaints have been made each year, with disciplinary sanctions being imposed in about four cases each year, Commission figures show. Commenting on those figures, European Women s Lobby secretary-general Joanna Maycock, told Reuters that the number of complaints seemed  very low  for the size of the workforce. The Commission s gender equality chief, Czech Commissioner Vera Jourova, said last week that she had herself been a victim of sexual harassment in the past but saw  stigmatization  as preventing many women in Brussels from speaking up. The Weinstein affair was, she feared, the  peak of the iceberg . Jourova was speaking to Brussels  Politico news service, which has set up a confidential website that has garnered more than 30 allegations in a week, from both women and men, of offences including rape, connected to the European Parliament. \",\n          \"Facebook Criticizes New German \\u2019Hate Speech\\u2019 Law for Social Media - Breitbart Facebook has criticized new German hate speech law that would see social media companies pay up to \\u20ac50 million in fines if they fail to remove \\u201chate speech\\u201d on their platform. [Business Insider reports that Facebook is unhappy with Germany\\u2019s new hate speech law that would force social media companies to face heavy fines for failure to remove hate speech and fake news from their platforms. Facebook has argued that these strict new measures will result in legal and legitimate content being deleted from their platform in order to avoid the fines.  The German government proposed legislation in March that would have social media companies fined if they didn\\u2019t quickly remove posts regarded as slanderous or threatening. Germany\\u2019s cabinet approved these plans in April, but they have yet to be implemented. The new law has now been challenged by Facebook. Facebook published a statement over the weekend which outlined why the new law \\u201cis not suitable to combat hate speech and false news. \\u201d \\u201cThe draft law provides an incentive to delete content that is not clearly illegal when social networks face such a disproportionate threat of fines,\\u201d Facebook claimed. \\u201cIt would have the effect of transferring responsibility for complex legal decisions from public authorities to private companies. And several legal experts have assessed the draft law as being against the German constitution and   with EU law. Facebook is committed to working in partnership with governments and civil society on solutions that will make this draft law unnecessary. \\u201d German Justice Minister Heiko Maas disagreed, stating, \\u201cThis (draft law) sets out binding standards for the way operators of social networks deal with complaints and obliges them to delete criminal content. \\u201d He added, \\u201cthere should be just as little tolerance for criminal rabble rousing on social networks as on the street. \\u201d If Facebook refuses to comply with the law, the individual deemed responsible for the company in German could receive a personal \\u20ac5 million fine, while Facebook as an organization could receive a fine of up to \\u20ac50 million.\",\n          \"Hero of Novorossiya: Honoring the death of Arsen Pavlov aka \\\"Motorola\\\" Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:01 UTC Arsen Pavlov, or Motorola, was the leader of the Sparta battalion in the war for Donbass. The people of Novorossiya (aka the Donbass) have suffered a terrible loss. Arsen Pavlov better known to the world as Motorola was assassinated in a brutal terrorist bombing on October 16, 2016. He was a beloved commander and a hero to the people of the Donbass, to Russia, and to people all over the world who oppose the fascist junta in Ukraine and US imperialism. The murder was no doubt ordered by the empire in revenge for Russia's intervention in Syria which one year later appears to have decisively shifted the war. On every front the SAA are making advances and winning new victories especially in the battle to fully liberate Aleppo from NATO's terrorist death squads. Thankfully after the treacherous bombing at Deir Ezzor Russia was in no mood to give into the empty threats of full scale nuclear war the empire claimed it was prepared to launch in order to halt the liberation of Eastern Aleppo. Slowly the SAA are making gains on multiple fronts in Eastern Ghoutha, in Homs, in Aleppo. Arsen Pavlov was born in the Komi Republic at 15 he became an orphan and moved in with a grandmother. He joined the Russian Naval Infantry where he gained the callsign Motorola. He joined as a conscript but volunteered to reenlist and served in the 2nd Chechen War where he gained valuable experience, and they say became addicted to war. He was a bit of an adrenaline junky which added to his charisma since he was paradoxically cheerful in the most dangerous situations. He had a great sense of humor which came through even to non-russian speakers like myself but he was even more beloved in Russia and Ukraine for his hilarious narrations of the war in Ukraine. He was involved in the war in Ukraine from the start. He visited Maidan where he overheard some Ukrainian fascists saying that they would kill ten Russians for every Ukrainian they lost. He decided to join the anti-maidan movement participating in counter-protests in Eastern Ukraine in Karkov and other cities before heading to Crimea to aid the people in fulfilling their long held dream of reuniting with Russia. It was in Crimea that he met Igor Strelkov who was impressed with his military experience and cheerful daring. Thus Motorola was one of the small group of men he brought with him to Slavyansk where a handful of veterans worked with the brave locals managing keep the Ukrainian Military tied down for months allowing vital time for Donetsk and Lugansk to solidify their defenses . In Slavyansk Strelkov and Motorola would become legends. Motorola became well known early on because not only was he a brave fighter he was also a master of information war. It was Motorola who filmed many of the early battles of the war and also helped sympathetic journalists cover the war from the front lines. He well understood that the wars of today are fought not just on the battlefields but on the internet, on youtube, on social media. He helped mobilize Global support for Novorossia's war to remain independent of fascist Ukraine inspiring volunteers from around the world. He was also able wage psychological warfare on the Ukrainians using his instincts as a prankster. He managed to convince the Ukrainians that there were 300 Chechen special forces aiding the Novorossian's in the area by playing a recording of the Muslim call to prayer every day. The paranoid Ukrainians fell for it and did not dare to invade the area. Motorola would go on to fight in many of the major battles of the war. He was not one of those commanders who lead from behind. Instead Motorola often fought on the front lines with his men. How could he ask his fighters to risk their lives when he would not do the same he would explain when questioned. Thus like the legendary Mozgovoi Motorola was reported dead many times in the course of the war by the Ukrainian media always reappearing to make a mockery of such claims. To do justice to his heroic actions in the war in Ukraine would require writing a history of much of the war since he was at so many famous battles Nikolayevka Semyonuka, Ilovaisk, Debaltsevo, Donetsk. He became the commander of the Spartak Battalion and was instrumental in liberating Donetsk airport from the fascist self styled \\\"cyborgs.\\\" He had a beautiful and courageous wife and three children. He was Officially declared a Hero of Novorossia and honored in Last years victory parade celebrating both the victory over fascism in \\\"The Great Patriotic War\\\" as World War 2 is known in Russia but also the victories in the 2014-2015 wars of independence that saw the NATO backed Fascist Ukrainian army and it's death squad allies thoroughly smashed.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron s call for a separate budget for the eurozone.  We should be ready to invest more in our future,  Gabriel told Germany s Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more.   Gabriel said Macron s proposals to reform the European Union would be  very important  in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. He said he was enthusiastic about Macron s core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player. The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections. Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron s proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place. Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January. Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a  roadmap  with all eurozone leaders by June. Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.     \",\n          \"Donald Trump likes feuds. He cannot, for any reason, take criticism, so the second someone says something less than a million percent complimentary about him, Trump has to lash out. His latest target is a union leader for Carrier, the company that Trump has been boasting about all over the place because he supposedly saved bunches of jobs. However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces. They swallow every outrage, every lie, as if none of it matters. They refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their Cheeto Jesus, and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes.Look forward to four years of not just Trump acting like a whiny, narcissistic baby, but, apparently, he ll have the might of the entire GOP behind him doing the same.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"The police in Brazil said on Saturday that they had made the first arrest in the search for more than 30 possible attackers in the gang rape of a    girl, a case that has prompted widespread outrage and vows by the federal government to combat crimes against women, news agencies reported. Brazilians reacted with shock after the May 21 assault came to light last week. Graphic photos and videos of the unconscious, naked teenager were posted on Twitter, and several men joked online about the attack. The authorities said the teenager had been raped in the S\\u00e3o Jo\\u00e3o shantytown on the west side of Rio de Janeiro as she was visiting her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The girl told the police that she was briefly alone with him but remembered nothing until she woke up naked the next day in another building among dozens of men who had guns. The first arrest came after the military police fanned out in search of four suspects who had been identified, the news organization Agence   reported. The police said they did not know if the boyfriend was one of the attackers, though he was being sought. The case has rocked Brazil, Latin America\\u2019s largest nation, and highlighted its   problem of violence against women. President Michel Temer promised to create a federal police unit to address crimes against women, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cIt\\u2019s absurd that in the 21st century we have to live with barbarous crimes like this,\\u201d said Mr. Temer, who also called an emergency meeting of the security ministers for each of Brazil\\u2019s states to consider   crimes. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio on Friday night with signs that said \\u201cMachismo kills\\u201d and \\u201cNo means no,\\u201d Agence   reported. In S\\u00e3o Paulo, protesters made a mural with messages that included \\u201cI like to wear necklines, that\\u2019s not an invitation to rape me. \\u201d The girl, in brief comments to the O Globo newspaper, said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the stigma that hurts me the most. It is as if people are saying: \\u2018It\\u2019s her fault. She was using scanty clothes.\\u2019 I want people to know that it is not the woman\\u2019s fault. You can\\u2019t blame a robbery victim for being robbed. \\u201d At a news conference on Friday, the police said the girl had reported being raped by 33 men officials said they had been unable to confirm how many men might have taken part. Rio\\u2019s police chief, Fernando Veloso, said that if images had not been posted online, the authorities might not have learned of the attack. The Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies found that more than 92, 000 women were killed in   crimes, including rape and domestic abuse, from 1980 to 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0437\\u0430 \\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435. \\u0411\\u043b\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u044e \\u0432\\u0430\\u0441.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63642,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MUSLIM LEADER Tells Secretive Islamic Compounds In U.S. To Arm Up After Trump Win: \\u201cHe has come as a test and trial for the faithful adherents of the holy books\\u201d [VIDEO] An Islamist group with secretive compounds around the U.S. is arming up in anticipation of raids by the incoming Trump administration, according to a new report from a nonprofit think tank.Muslims of America, which is headquartered in Hancock, N.Y., and run from Pakistan by leader Sheikh Gilani, operates 22  Islamic villages  around the nation. The compounds are legal, but Gilani has recently ordered all unarmed members to gather firearms, licenses and hunting permits, according to Clarion Project. Gilani believes his group will be targeted by Trump. I foretold disastrous results should this man be elected as the American President,  Gilani said in a statement shortly after Trump was elected president on Nov. 8.  He has come as a test and trial for the faithful adherents of the holy books. Supporters say the compounds are simply Islamic communes for mainly African-American Muslims who seek to follow Gilani s teachings in a rural setting. While they have been the subject of numerous accusations and undercover reporting, the group is not known to have supported or conducted terrorist activity, and its critics are widely dismissed as conspiracy theorists.A confidential source allegedly inside the organization told Martin Mawyer of the Christian Action Network and Ryan Mauro of the Clarion Project that the group expects the FBI to reopen its cases against them as a  homegrown terrorist organization,  according to the report.Here is Clarion Project s National Security Analyst Ryan Mauro explaining why we need to be concerned about these Muslim compounds:Watch this report on  NO-GO Zones  scattered around the United States:Alex Jones reporter Joe Biggs traveled to Islamberg compound in upstate New York. He found the people living in the compound have isolated themselves from everyone on the outside. The local chief of police told Biggs that the residents handle everything internally. The founder of Islamberg is a founder of a terrorist organization out of Pakistan: According to the report, the sources stated that members across the country were given instructions by Gilani to  be prepared to fight,  against President-Elect Trump, who the group believes is part of a satanic-Zionist conspiracy to destroy Islam.Muslims of America s headquarters in rural New York is known as  Islamberg.  According to a 2007 FBI report obtained by the Clarion Project, MOA  possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns within the U.S. and overseas.

You cannot look at President Trump and call the American president the leader of the free world  fretted the leftist Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer to Engel,  Because America has increasingly abdicated its legitimacy to that title. Engel claimed that the only world leaders to welcome a President Trump was a vast array of some of the world worst despots,  Those welcoming the most were right-wing parties, who rushed to embrace Trump as their new hero.  Engels was eager to tie as many of them to Trump as possible: He s like me,  joked the Filipino president, accused of turning his police into anti-narco death squads. Egypt s General Sisi, who came to power in a coup bragged he was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron s call for a separate budget for the eurozone.  We should be ready to invest more in our future,  Gabriel told Germany s Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more.   Gabriel said Macron s proposals to reform the European Union would be  very important  in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. He said he was enthusiastic about Macron s core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player. The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections. Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron s proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place. Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January. Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a  roadmap  with all eurozone leaders by June. Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.     \",\n          \"Donald Trump likes feuds. He cannot, for any reason, take criticism, so the second someone says something less than a million percent complimentary about him, Trump has to lash out. His latest target is a union leader for Carrier, the company that Trump has been boasting about all over the place because he supposedly saved bunches of jobs. However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces. They swallow every outrage, every lie, as if none of it matters. They refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their Cheeto Jesus, and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes.Look forward to four years of not just Trump acting like a whiny, narcissistic baby, but, apparently, he ll have the might of the entire GOP behind him doing the same.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"The police in Brazil said on Saturday that they had made the first arrest in the search for more than 30 possible attackers in the gang rape of a    girl, a case that has prompted widespread outrage and vows by the federal government to combat crimes against women, news agencies reported. Brazilians reacted with shock after the May 21 assault came to light last week. Graphic photos and videos of the unconscious, naked teenager were posted on Twitter, and several men joked online about the attack. The authorities said the teenager had been raped in the S\\u00e3o Jo\\u00e3o shantytown on the west side of Rio de Janeiro as she was visiting her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The girl told the police that she was briefly alone with him but remembered nothing until she woke up naked the next day in another building among dozens of men who had guns. The first arrest came after the military police fanned out in search of four suspects who had been identified, the news organization Agence   reported. The police said they did not know if the boyfriend was one of the attackers, though he was being sought. The case has rocked Brazil, Latin America\\u2019s largest nation, and highlighted its   problem of violence against women. President Michel Temer promised to create a federal police unit to address crimes against women, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cIt\\u2019s absurd that in the 21st century we have to live with barbarous crimes like this,\\u201d said Mr. Temer, who also called an emergency meeting of the security ministers for each of Brazil\\u2019s states to consider   crimes. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio on Friday night with signs that said \\u201cMachismo kills\\u201d and \\u201cNo means no,\\u201d Agence   reported. In S\\u00e3o Paulo, protesters made a mural with messages that included \\u201cI like to wear necklines, that\\u2019s not an invitation to rape me. \\u201d The girl, in brief comments to the O Globo newspaper, said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the stigma that hurts me the most. It is as if people are saying: \\u2018It\\u2019s her fault. She was using scanty clothes.\\u2019 I want people to know that it is not the woman\\u2019s fault. You can\\u2019t blame a robbery victim for being robbed. \\u201d At a news conference on Friday, the police said the girl had reported being raped by 33 men officials said they had been unable to confirm how many men might have taken part. Rio\\u2019s police chief, Fernando Veloso, said that if images had not been posted online, the authorities might not have learned of the attack. The Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies found that more than 92, 000 women were killed in   crimes, including rape and domestic abuse, from 1980 to 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0437\\u0430 \\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435. \\u0411\\u043b\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u044e \\u0432\\u0430\\u0441.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63642,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MUSLIM LEADER Tells Secretive Islamic Compounds In U.S. To Arm Up After Trump Win: \\u201cHe has come as a test and trial for the faithful adherents of the holy books\\u201d [VIDEO] An Islamist group with secretive compounds around the U.S. is arming up in anticipation of raids by the incoming Trump administration, according to a new report from a nonprofit think tank.Muslims of America, which is headquartered in Hancock, N.Y., and run from Pakistan by leader Sheikh Gilani, operates 22  Islamic villages  around the nation. The compounds are legal, but Gilani has recently ordered all unarmed members to gather firearms, licenses and hunting permits, according to Clarion Project. Gilani believes his group will be targeted by Trump. I foretold disastrous results should this man be elected as the American President,  Gilani said in a statement shortly after Trump was elected president on Nov. 8.  He has come as a test and trial for the faithful adherents of the holy books. Supporters say the compounds are simply Islamic communes for mainly African-American Muslims who seek to follow Gilani s teachings in a rural setting. While they have been the subject of numerous accusations and undercover reporting, the group is not known to have supported or conducted terrorist activity, and its critics are widely dismissed as conspiracy theorists.A confidential source allegedly inside the organization told Martin Mawyer of the Christian Action Network and Ryan Mauro of the Clarion Project that the group expects the FBI to reopen its cases against them as a  homegrown terrorist organization,  according to the report.Here is Clarion Project s National Security Analyst Ryan Mauro explaining why we need to be concerned about these Muslim compounds:Watch this report on  NO-GO Zones  scattered around the United States:Alex Jones reporter Joe Biggs traveled to Islamberg compound in upstate New York. He found the people living in the compound have isolated themselves from everyone on the outside. The local chief of police told Biggs that the residents handle everything internally. The founder of Islamberg is a founder of a terrorist organization out of Pakistan: According to the report, the sources stated that members across the country were given instructions by Gilani to  be prepared to fight,  against President-Elect Trump, who the group believes is part of a satanic-Zionist conspiracy to destroy Islam.Muslims of America s headquarters in rural New York is known as  Islamberg.  According to a 2007 FBI report obtained by the Clarion Project, MOA  possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns within the U.S. and overseas.

You cannot look at President Trump and call the American president the leader of the free world  fretted the leftist Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer to Engel,  Because America has increasingly abdicated its legitimacy to that title. Engel claimed that the only world leaders to welcome a President Trump was a vast array of some of the world worst despots,  Those welcoming the most were right-wing parties, who rushed to embrace Trump as their new hero.  Engels was eager to tie as many of them to Trump as possible: He s like me,  joked the Filipino president, accused of turning his police into anti-narco death squads. Egypt s General Sisi, who came to power in a coup bragged he was the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump.
